# Messaging app using ZeroMQ library

## What is it ?

I'm trying to build an online chatroom using ZeroMQ. The end goal is to have something encrypted, secure, fast, easily scalable and, especially, easily deployable by anyone. It should be as easy as opening the server app and the chatroom is online.
Anyone that should have access now can securely communicate without having to rely on any third party server or service other than internet providers. 

## Utilities

Dependencies: libzmq3-dev (on debian)
